## Overview

The main goal of this lab is to improve and expand feature engineering skills. We also want to develop a better sense of how to handle missing data.

## Instructions

After creating a GitHub repo and connecting it to RStudio, students should work through the instructions provided in `LO3_feature_engineering_revisited.html`. A template is provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L03.Rmd).

Students will need to submit their rendered html file which should contain a link to their github repo. See canvas for submission details.
